# flycheck-po â€” Flycheck for po-mode

This provides the `po-msgfmt` syntax checker for Flycheck, which runs
`msgfmt -c` over the file.  This is the same as what `po-validate`
does, but integrated with Flycheck.

## Installation

Open `flycheck-po.el` and run `package-install-from-buffer`.  This
will set everything up.
